		<h1>Planning for the Future</h1>
		<p>For many people, funeral plans have become an established form of forward thinking and providing for the future. A funeral plan can give you peace of mind, knowing that your family will not be burdened with having to make difficult decisions in a time of grief.</p>
	</article>
	<article class="plan-content__text">	
		<p>In association with the Golden Charter, we offer the Independent Way funeral plan, only available through independent funeral directors. The Independent Way not only enables you to make financial provisions for your funeral, but also to tailor a bespoke ceremony to your wishes.</p>
		<h2>Guaranteed cover for all of our services</h2>
		<p>Regardless of how much the cost of our services may rise in the years to come, the plan guarantees that neither you nor your loved ones will be asked for any excess payments. Your payment will go to the Golden Charter Trust, which will hold the money for your funeral on our behalf. There are some costs, however, that we are obliged to pay on your behalf and which do not account for our services. These are known as disbursements and include charges for cemeteries, crematoria, medical fees and the clergy. This is out of our control and may require an additional payment.</p>
		<h2>Financial Peace of mind</h2>
		<p>Because your payments go directly into the Golden Charter trust, you can be confident of your plan’s security. The trust is a separate legal entity to the Golden Charter, which means that even if something untoward happens to the company, the trust will continue until every plan has been carried out. </p>

		<h2>Types of plans</h2>
		<p>The Golden Charter offers three different types of funeral plan, ranging from the simple to the elaborate. You can read more about each of the plans below or alternatively, contact one of our experienced funeral directors for a more in-depth discussion.</p>
