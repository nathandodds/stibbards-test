		<h1>Chapel of rest</h1>
		<p class="sub-content__top">The chapel of rest is a quiet, dignified environment in which friends and family can pay their last respects to the loved one. Each of our offices has its own private chapel of rest and we will do our utmost to make your visit as comforting as possible.</p>
		<h3>Paying your last respects</h3>
		<p>We want to ensure that your visit is as peaceful as possible. This is why we ask for appointments to be made and the following guidance to be noted.</p>
		<p>Once funeral arrangements have been made, we recommend that at least three working days should be left before families make appointments at the chapel of rest. This gives time for the completion of paperwork, the preparation of the coffin and the care of the deceased. Please be aware that three days is only a guide and on occasion may have to be extended depending on individual circumstance.</p>

		<h3>How to book your appointment</h3>
		<p>Appointments for visits to the chapel of rest should be made through the office where the funeral has been arranged, during normal office hours.</p>
		<p>Visits to the chapel of rest last for half an hour. If you feel that your family requires longer than this, please let us know when booking your visit. Families may arrange one half hour visit to the chapel of rest out outside of office hours per day. Each subsequent half hour will incur an additional Â£25 fee to cover staff attendance.</p>
